## My first website!

Welcome to my very first landing page! I built this one page website from stratch to cover up key objective that I set!

Firstly, it is mid-November 2020 when I am writing this README.md, roughly 2 months and a half through my web developer journey. I thought it was a perfect time to consolidate and use the basic stacks of skills that I learned üöÄüöÄ! Moving forward, I will move my focus on learning MERN stack. The skills that I showcased in this website **-html, css(compiled from sass) and javascript-** will surely be wonderful foundations!

Secondly, I wanted to build a portfolio site that records my learning and this website acheives that. 

- Believing the best way to learn web development is to actually build something, I grasped the skills by building mini projects as many (‚ÄºÔ∏è) as possible. Some works that I recently built are represented on **the desktop version**_(above 1200px viewport width)_ of this website with `drag and drop JavaScript applied.` Links are provided for the rest of the 10+ mini projects as well!

- I equally put efforts on learning **`Data Analytics`** to upgrade my current business expertise (_my background is tourism business_). I have levelled up my tech. skills to boost up work efficiency (i.e. through automation or many things that Microsoft Excel is limited at). I am doing this with great helps of libraries on `Python.` I created my **own curriculum** on the way to master the skills, which are showcased on this website, while links are provided to access some of my works compiled on GitHub.

Thanks and hope you enjoy! üòâ
